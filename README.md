# Curqui_test #
Tests for the ft_printf project of 42.

## Important
To get all green tests doesn't mean your ft_printf is good.<br/>
To get some red tests doesn't mean your ft_printf isn't good.<br/>

Dear corrected people, don't fix a test to get a green line. Understand, think, and make a choice to be consistent with YOUR ft_printf.<br/>
Dear correctors, don't use my tests to put a zero. Understand, think, and listen to the corrected student.

Not obvious for everyone so far...

## Usage
1) Copy your libftprintf.a at the root of your repository.
2) `make`
3) `./ft_printf_tests`
4) For some details, check `rslt_trace.txt`

/!\ Don't compile your libftprintf.a with sanitize !

## Contributing
Don't hesitate to create a Pull Request if a test is missing.
The test must compile with the flags `-Wall -Wextra -Werror`.
Thanks for your contribution :)
